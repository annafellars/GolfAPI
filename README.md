This code is an example of how to use an API in python to create a dataframe. 
I choose a PGA Golf API which can be found at https://rapidapi.com/slashgolf/api/live-golf-data
Once I created a data frame I was able to do a simple EDA using my golf dataframe.
If you have any questions you can refer to my blog post which provides an deeper explanation https://annafellars.github.io/annablog/blog/PGA-Analysis/
