This code is an example of how to use an API in Python to create a data frame. 
I chose a PGA Golf API which can be found at https://rapidapi.com/slashgolf/api/live-golf-data
Once I created a data frame I was able to do a simple EDA using my golf data frame. You can find the raw csv file and the cleaned csv file in this repository.
If you have any questions you can refer to my blog post which provides a deeper explanation: https://annafellars.github.io/annablog/blog/PGA-Analysis/
